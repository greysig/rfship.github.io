<p>
B.S. Computer Networking and CyberSecurity, but as I begin to look at the field, I find that security is more a mindset and thinking about the technology the organization is implementing. Today, I find interest in how technologies pass data between one another. Moreover, wireless communication of all form (802.11, Bluetooth, mobile, etc.) have my current interest, but I would like to expand to microwave and satelite technologies. When I see an antenna on a light pull or a little dish point in so odd direction I wonder what it's doing, where it's going and wh'y its there. <br/> </br>
I have a general wonder about how things works, which can be good, but also bad as its easy to run down the rabbit hole when learning about new and exciting topics.
 		
<br/><br/>
I recently (2/13) got my CWA which was a nice overview of the radio frequencies and technologies. My next goal is to obtain the CCNAW which means getting my CCNA and CCNET.

							<article id="wireless">
								<h2 class="major">802.11 Standards</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/wifi.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>intro:</h3>
									<p>802.11 is a set of specifications for implementing local wireless networks or WLAN. The specifciations include the Medium Access Control and Physical Layer. These radio devices communicate at 2.4, 5, and new ones up to the 45/60GHz frequencies. Some you you will see use the 2.4GHz ISM band or the 5 GHz. This is largely do to the 2.4 band becoming over populated creating a lot of noise. The 5 GHz which was less used allowed for a great practice speed. However with higher carrier frequency the signal does not travel as far as the 2.4 carrier frequency. </p>
									<p>I will add more detail to each standard however to avoid having a blank page I added overviews of each standard. </p>

								<h4>Legacy:</h4>
									<p>With a speed of 1 or 2 Mbits/s it is easy to see why bluetooth was once considered an alternative to wifi. Released in 1997, 802.11 has forward error correction code with three alternative physical layer technologies: Infradred-1Mb/s, frequency-hopping-1 or 2Mb/s, and direct-sequence- 1 or 2Mb/s.</p>
								<h4>802.11a:</h4>
									<p>802.11a operates at 5.8 GHz and allows transmission and reception speed of 1.5 to 54 Mb/s. Using the same data link layer protocol and frame format of the original standard, it implements OFDM waveform for its interface. Because of the high carrier frequency, 802.11a has smaller wavelengths which results in not being able to travel through walls or other objects.</p>
									
								<h4>802.11b:</h4>
									<p>Max speed of 11Mb/s, B is the direct extension of the modulation technique which was defined by the original 802.11 standard.</p>
								<h4>802.11g:</h4>
									<p>Operating in the 2.4 band with the use of the OFDM transmission scheme as the A standard. 802.11g has a max data rate of about 54Mb/s but in practices was low 20s. Designed to be backwards compatible with the b standard allow end users to not have to upgrade their network card. </p>
								<h4>802.11n:</h4>
									<p>The N standard build on the previous 802.11 standards by adding MIMO, multiple-input multiple-output antennnas. N operates at both the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands. With speeds from 54Mb/s to 600Mb/s</p>
								<h4>802.11ac:</h4>
									<p>Building off N, the ac standard provided wider channels in the 5 GHz band, had higher-order modulation(256-QAM) and the addition of Mu-MIMO (Multi-user MIMO). Providing data rates of 400+MB/s  </p>
								<h4>New and Upcoming:</h4>
									<p>AD, AF, AH, AY</p>

						<h2>Bluetooth</h2>
							<p>Operates at 2.4GHz-2.485GHz on the ISM band and can hold a connection within ranges from 60m max for 4.0 and up 240m max for version 5.0. Bluetoth uses spread spectum and works by having a master and client. To discover a device, one will listen to the inquirey scan channel. To connect, a device sends a data on the paging channel.</p>

						<h4>Version 4.0 + LE</h4>
							<p>Bluetooth Low Engergy aims to allow application to run off coin cells. The design allowed for two types of implementation. Dual mode which uses the low engery protocol stack and single mode which combines Bluetooth Smart function and classic controller. Changes to 4.0v included the ability to support BLE, Generic Atribute Profile(GATT), and Security Manager(SM) with AES encryption. Bluetooth Smart was </p>
							<h4>Version 5.0</h4>
							 	<p>Bluetooth 5 will quadruple the range, and double the speed of version 4.0, as well as provide an 8x increase in data speeds </p>
					
						

				<!-- Zigbee-->
						<h2>Zigbee</h2>
							<p>Used as a wireless networking standard, zigbee aims to target the remote control and sensor applications. Distance can be achieved up to about 70m, however it is possible to use relay for longer distance. Using the un licenses bands 2.4HGz and 915 MHz, zigbee provides a max data rate up to 250kbps for 2.4 band and uses offset quadrature phase shift keying. 915MHz band provides a max date rate of 40kbps with a form of binary phase shift keying. Both bands use the Direct squence spread spectrum. less expensive than other wireless personal area netowrks, it is based on the IEEE 802.15.4 specifications for high level communication protocols used for PANs and only meant for small scale projects. </p>

Using Windows? I recommend you use the OpenWRT's documentation below.</br>

<h4><span style="color: #cccccc;"><b>Creating SSH Key: &nbsp;</b></span></h4>
<p><b>Host:</b></br>
Creating and ssh-key for the router. 
</br></br>
<code style="margin-left: 40px">ssh-keygen -t dsa</code>
</br></br>
Next we will use the Secure Copy command to send the ssh-key from the host to the client to the OpenWRT router. 
</br></br>
<code style="margin-left: 40px">scp ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub root@192.168.X.X:/tmp</code>
</br></br>
<b>Router:</b>
</br>
Next we will log into the router to authorize the ssh-key
</br></br>
<code style="margin-left: 40px">ssh root@192.168.X.X></code>
</br></br>
Change directory to dropbear (Still understanding dropbear. I'll post more when I look into to.)
</br></br>
<code style="margin-left: 40px">cd /etc/dropbear</code>
</br></br>
Next we will add the ssh-key to the to the list authorized keys acceptd.
</br></br>
<code style="margin-left: 40px">cat /tmp/id_*.pub &gt;&gt; authorized_keys</code>
</br></br>

Most, if not all the content in this page can be found on <a href="https://www.aircrack-ng.org/">Aircrack-ng's site</a> but has been organized for my (maybe our) benefit. Currently just the basics have been posted but I plan on going back as I learn and master other skills.  <br />
Screen shots are taken from a little netbook I own that is currently running Kali 2.0 for convinces. <br />

First we have to make sure that there are no process running that can get in the way.

Little bit of an explanation &nbsp;-c wit be your target , 6 for me. -w simply mean write to then the path and name of file you wish to write out to. Finally you have the interface you are listening on. The command will begin to capture data. When you exit or quit the command it will output four files with various information.<br />
