<p>
B.S. Computer Networking and CyberSecurity, but as I begin to look at the field, I find that security is more a mindset and thinking about the technology the organization is implementing. Today, I find interest in how technologies pass data between one another. Moreover, wireless communication of all form (802.11, Bluetooth, mobile, etc.) have my current interest, but I would like to expand to microwave and satelite technologies. When I see an antenna on a light pull or a little dish point in so odd direction I wonder what it's doing, where it's going and wh'y its there. <br/> </br>
I have a general wonder about how things works, which can be good, but also bad as its easy to run down the rabbit hole when learning about new and exciting topics.
 		
<br/><br/>
I recently (2/13) got my CWA which was a nice overview of the radio frequencies and technologies. My next goal is to obtain the CCNAW which means getting my CCNA and CCNET.

							<article id="ieee">
								<h2 class="major">802.11 Standards</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/wifi.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Intro:</h3>
									<p>802.11 is a set of specifications for implementing local wireless networks or WLAN. The specifciations include the Medium Access Control and Physical Layer. These radio devices communicate at 2.4, 5, and new ones up to the 45/60GHz frequencies. Some you you will see use the 2.4GHz ISM band or the 5 GHz. This is largely do to the 2.4 band becoming over populated creating a lot of noise. The 5 GHz which was less used allowed for a great practice speed. However with higher carrier frequency the signal does not travel as far as the 2.4 carrier frequency. </p>
									<p>I will add more detail to each standard however to avoid having a blank page I added overviews of each standard. </p>

								<h4>Legacy:</h4>
									<p>With a speed of 1 or 2 Mbits/s it is easy to see why bluetooth was once considered an alternative to wifi. Released in 1997, 802.11 has forward error correction code with three alternative physical layer technologies: Infradred-1Mb/s, frequency-hopping-1 or 2Mb/s, and direct-sequence- 1 or 2Mb/s.</p>
								<h4>802.11a:</h4>
									<p>802.11a operates at 5.8 GHz and allows transmission and reception speed of 1.5 to 54 Mb/s. Using the same data link layer protocol and frame format of the original standard, it implements OFDM waveform for its interface. Because of the high carrier frequency, 802.11a has smaller wavelengths which results in not being able to travel through walls or other objects.</p>
									
								<h4>802.11b:</h4>
									<p>Max speed of 11Mb/s, B is the direct extension of the modulation technique which was defined by the original 802.11 standard.</p>
								<h4>802.11g:</h4>
									<p>Operating in the 2.4 band with the use of the OFDM transmission scheme as the A standard. 802.11g has a max data rate of about 54Mb/s but in practices was low 20Mb/s. Designed to be backwards compatible with the b standard allow end users to not have to upgrade their network card. </p>
								<h4>802.11n:</h4>
									<p>The N standard build on the previous 802.11 standards by adding MIMO, multiple-input multiple-output antennnas. N operates at both the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands. With speeds from 54Mb/s to 600Mb/s</p>
								<h4>802.11ac:</h4>
									<p>Building off N, the ac standard provided wider channels in the 5 GHz band, had higher-order modulation(256-QAM) and the addition of Mu-MIMO (Multi-user MIMO). Providing data rates of 400+MB/s  </p>
								<h4>802.11s</h4>
									<p>S, defines the routing protocol that is used for wireless mesh networks. Support by default is for Hybrid Wireless Mesh Protocols and offers support for other mesh and ad-hoc network protocols: OLSR or BATMAN.</p>
								<h4>New and Upcoming:</h4>
									<p>AD, AF, AH, AY</p>

						<h2>Bluetooth</h2>
							<p>Operates at 2.4GHz-2.485GHz on the ISM band and can hold a connection within ranges from 60m max for 4.0 and up 240m max for version 5.0. Bluetoth uses spread spectum and works by having a master and client. To discover a device, one will listen to the inquirey scan channel. To connect, a device sends a data on the paging channel.</p>

						<h4>Version 4.0 + LE</h4>
							<p>Bluetooth Low Engergy aims to allow application to run off coin cells. The design allowed for two types of implementation. Dual mode which uses the low engery protocol stack and single mode which combines Bluetooth Smart function and classic controller. Changes to 4.0v included the ability to support BLE, Generic Atribute Profile(GATT), and Security Manager(SM) with AES encryption. Bluetooth Smart was </p>
							<h4>Version 5.0</h4>
							 	<p>Bluetooth 5 will quadruple the range, and double the speed of version 4.0, as well as provide an 8x increase in data speeds </p>
					
						

				<!-- Zigbee-->
						<h2>Zigbee</h2>
							<p>Used as a wireless networking standard, zigbee aims to target the remote control and sensor applications. Distance can be achieved up to about 70m, however it is possible to use relay for longer distance. Using the un licenses bands 2.4HGz and 915 MHz, zigbee provides a max data rate up to 250kbps for 2.4 band and uses offset quadrature phase shift keying. 915MHz band provides a max date rate of 40kbps with a form of binary phase shift keying. Both bands use the Direct squence spread spectrum. less expensive than other wireless personal area netowrks, it is based on the IEEE 802.15.4 specifications for high level communication protocols used for PANs and only meant for small scale projects. </p>
						<h2>WAVE (802.11p)</h2>
							<p>WAVE is an approved amendment to the 802.11 standard, wireless access in vehicular environments, is  a vehicular communication system. It uses a 75 Mhz bandwidth in the 5.9 GHz band. </p>

						<h4>Transmitter:</h4>
	
	<p>Initial componet in the creation of a wireless medium. Data is handed off to the transmitter to begin the RF communication. 
	
	Process: When the data is recieved will start the AC (alternating current) siganl. The signal will produce the frequency  of the transimission, the AC will ocsillate around 2.4 billion times per second for 802.11b frequency (2.4GHz) or if the wireless frequency is 5GHz it will ocsillate 5 billion times per second. 
	
	The transmitter will then modulate to encode data with in the signal. Once the signal as been encoded it becomes a carrier signal. The carrier signal is then set either strait to an antenna or carried through a cable. The transmitter is also responsible for the amplitude or the power level that the signal is sent as.</p> 



<h4>Antenna:</h4>
	
	<p>An antenna has two function, it can either send or receive an RF signal. If the antenna recieve a signal of the air it sends the AC signal down to the receiver to be convert to bits and bytes. The antenna can also radiate the signal in a pattern specific to the antenna type. 

	Isotropic Radiator: Point source that radiates signal equally in all directions. (think of a sun) Unfortunately it is impossible to manufacture an antenna that can radiate out equally  because of the structure of the antenna itself influances the transmission. 

	To increase the power from the antenna one can either provide more power at the transmitter or focus the RF signal that is radiating out of the antenna.</p> 


<h4>Receiver:</h4>
	
	<p>A receiver takes the carrier signal from antenna, translates the modulation to 1s and 0s, and passed the data along to the comptuer to be processed. </p>


<h4>Equivalent Isotropically Radiate Power (EIRP)</h4>

	<p>EIRP: the hightest RF signal stregth that is transimitted from a particular antenna. </p>

<h4>RFMath:</h4>
	
	<h6>Watt:</h6>
		<p>Basic unit of power, 1 watt= 1 amp of current flowing at 1 volt. A milliwatt (mW) is 1/1000 of a watt. Most 802.11 equipment trasmits between 1 and 100 mWs.</p>
	<h6>Decibel (dB)</h6>
	<p>A decibel(dB) is a unit of comparison and not a unit of messurement or power. dBs are used to compare power between to things such as two transmitters or the EIRP.</p> 
	
		<p>-dBi: is used to represent the theoretical output of an antenna. Therefore, an other way saying it, is a decibel gain relative to an isotropic adiator. dBi value is measured at the strongest point or focus point of the antenna signal. This also means that the dBi should always be positive because one is focusing their engery in one direction.  So if you see dBi think antenna gain.</p> 

		<p>-dBd: Decibel gain relative to a dipole antenna. This means that the value of the dBd increases in gain when comparing the signal to a dipole antenna. Since we are compare two or more antennas, it is important to remember that this is a unit of comparision.  </p>

		<p>-dBm: Is a comparison between a singal and 1 milliwatt of power, decible relative to 1 mW. </p>

	
			
<h4>Received Signal Strength Idicator (RSSI)</h4>
	
	<p>Optional 802.11 parameter with a value from 0-255, designed as a relative measurement of the RF power that is received. Used to determine if another device is transmitting. It is also using as a factor when a client is deciding if it should roam to another access point or not. Understand RSSI can help when multiple computers are using the same wireless cards.</p>
	<p>However the RSSI is assigned by the vendor there for a few problems may arise. Assuming all things equal vendor A may indicate a  ginal with a RSSI value of 30 and vendor B 15. If your were to compare the two cards with out additional information you may think that vendor A has the more sensitive card. Another problem is that manufacturers will take their range of RSSI value and compare them to different ranges of dBm values. Ex: Vendor A, 150 RSSI scale and compares it to  -120dBm to -40dBm. Vendor B, could have RSSI 50 comparing it to -90 dBm to -10 dBm. </p>


<h4>System Operating Margin (SOM)/Link Budget:</h4>

	<p>SOM/link budget is the calculation of the amount of RF signal received minus the amount of singal required by the receive. </p>

		<code>SOM = received signal - receive sensitivity</code>
